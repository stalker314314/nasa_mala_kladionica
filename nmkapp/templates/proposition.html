<ul class="proposition">
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}You are betting on one whole round. In cup phase, you are betting on each part separately - eighth-finals, quarterfinals, semifinals and final.{% endblocktrans %}
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}There is no discrimination, we are taking odds from the first booking site that publishes them (this is because we want to enable you to bet as soon as possible). Odds on nmk.bet are <strong>not changing</strong> after initial publishing.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}You are betting only on final result (1X2) in regular game time.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}All registered accounts that are not playing for money and do not bet in first round will be automatically deleted (not to waste precious space in standings).{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}Odds are not being multiplied, but added.
If you lose a bet in one match, it does not affect your final score from the same round.
You can look at this as you are betting a single ticket for each and every match and your stake is 1 point.
This means, if you win a match with an odd of 3.4, you will get 3.4 points.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}You are not able to see other players' bets until you click 'Final Decision'.
After that point, you will be able to see other players' bets, but that doesn't mean they also clicked 'Final Decision', e.g. other players might be able to still modify their respective bets.
At the start of the match in round, the bets are final for all players. Betting is not allowed after that point for that round.{% endblocktrans %}

        {% blocktrans %}This web site must be available 24/7.
If web site is not available for more than 10 minutes, or we notice any online attacks that can compromise or affect fair competition, the whole competition will be cancelled and all money will be returned to their respective players.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}If there are multiple players with same amount of points, the prize money will be split out of all places they are on.
Example: if John and Jane are first and they have 50 points each, they are splitting the prize money for both 1. and 2. place &mdash; (50% + 33.3%) / 2 = 41.66%.
If Peter is below them with 49 points, Peter gets the prize for the 3. place, e.g. 16.6%.{% endblocktrans %}
